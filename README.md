The goal of the game is to prevent the asteroid from falling for as long as possible.

To reach the aim a gun is used. It can change the angle and make single shoot.
## Control
Some settings information about control are placed in *Option* menu (right bottom corner).

**Notice**

The size of the window can be change which affects on gameplay.
